abstract = {Background
Telemedicine may help improve care quality and patient outcomes. Telemedicine for intraoperative decision support has not been rigorously studied.
Methods
This was a single-centre randomised clinical trial of unselected adult surgical patients. Patients were randomised to receive usual care or decision support from a telemedicine service, which provided real-time recommendations to intraoperative anaesthesia clinicians based on case reviews and physiological alerts. ORs were randomised 1:1. The co-primary outcomes were 30-day all-cause mortality, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and delirium in the intensive care unit, analysed by intention to treat.
Results
Between July 1, 2019, and January 31, 2023, a total of 35,302 patients were randomised to receive telemedicine support, with 36,625 receiving usual care. Telemedicine clinicians provided review in 11,812/35,302 cases, with alerts delivered to 2044/35,302 patients. Telemedicine support had no effect on any of the co-primary outcomes. Within 30 days, 630/35,302 (1.8%) patients randomised to telemedicine died within 30 days, compared with 649/36,625 (1.8%) receiving usual care (relative risk [RR]1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87–1.16, P=0.98). Telemedicine support did not alter postoperative respiratory failure [telemedicine 1071/33,996 (3.2%) vs usual care 1130/35,236 (3.2%), RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88–1.09, P=0.98], acute kidney injury [telemedicine 2316/33 251 (7.0%) vs usual care 2432/34,441 (7.1%); RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92–1.06, P=0.98], or delirium [telemedicine 1264/3873 (32.6%) vs usual care 1298/4044 (32.1%), RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94–1.10, P=0.98].
Conclusions
In this large randomised clinical trial, intraoperative telemedicine decision support using real-time alerts and case reviews had no impact on adverse postoperative outcomes.

	abstract = {The world population is shifting sharply toward an older-age demographic. To navigate the escalating burden of physical and cognitive decline common to aging, and heightened risk of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease, we require advances in treatment and prevention interventions. These advances are predicated on attaining a deeper understanding of the molecular processes underlying brain aging. Here, we employed novel GWAS and cis-eQTL-based polygenic risk scores (GWASAGE-PRS and cis-eQTLAGE-PRS) indexing genetic risk for accelerated molecular brain aging, and examined their associations with cortical thickness and performance in age-sensitive cognitive domains in 31 384 participants (16 392 women, age 64.1{\textpm}7.65) from the UK Biobank. While GWASAGE-PRS was nominally associated with lower cortical thickness in frontotemporal regions, cis-eQTLAGE-PRS displayed robust associations with greater cortical thickness in age-sensitive frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, including the left and right precentral (pFDR\&lt;0.0001, pFDR=0.05), left insula (pFDR=0.05), as well as the right supramarginal (pFDR=0.05) and precuneus (pFDR=0.05) regions. Similar pFDR trending associations occurred bilaterally in the caudal middle frontal (pFDR=0.052, pFDR=0.078) and right insula (pFDR=0.071). These structural findings co-occurred alongside increased executive function performance on the Trail Making Test B (pFDR=0.035), suggesting a potential neurostructural and cognitive reserve phenotype. This resilience profile may reflect previously uncharacterized pathways of brain reserve in age-related pathology, informing future translational research identifying novel treatment and prevention targets.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

ABSTRACT = {Cognitive decline is a public health concern affecting about 50 million individuals worldwide. Neuroticism, defined as the trait disposition to experience intense and frequent negative emotions, has been associated with an increased risk of late-life cognitive decline. However, the underlying biological mechanisms of this association remain unknown. This study investigated the relationship between genetic predisposition to neuroticism, computed by polygenic risk score (PRS), and performance in cognitive domains of reasoning, processing speed, visual attention, and memory in individuals over age 60. The sample consisted of UK Biobank participants with genetic and cognitive data available (N = 10,737, 4686 females; mean age = 63.4 ± 2.71). The cognitive domains were assessed at baseline for all participants and seven years later for a subset (N = 645, 262 females; mean age = 62.9 ± 2.44). Neuroticism PRS was not associated cross-sectionally with cognitive measures (p > 0.05). However, the trajectory of change for processing speed (β = 0.020; 95% CI = [0.006, 0.035], adjusted p = 0.0148), visual attention (β = −0.077; 95% CI = [−0.0985, −0.0553], adjusted p = 1.412 × 10−11), and memory (β = −0.033; 95% CI = [−0.0535, −0.0131], adjusted p = 0.005) was significantly associated with neuroticism PRS. Specifically, a higher genetic predisposition to neuroticism was associated with less decline in these cognitive domains. This trend persisted after sensitivity analysis using complete cases, although it only remained nominally significant for visual attention.},

abstract = {Objective:
An applied problem facing all areas of data science is harmonizing data sources. Joining data from multiple origins with unmapped and only partially overlapping features is a prerequisite to developing and testing robust, generalizable algorithms, especially in healthcare. This integrating is usually resolved using meta-data such as feature names, which may be unavailable or ambiguous. Our goal is to design methods that create a mapping between structured tabular datasets derived from electronic health records independent of meta-data.
Methods:
We evaluate methods in the challenging case of numeric features without reliable and distinctive univariate summaries, such as nearly Gaussian and binary features. We assume that a small set of features are a priori mapped between two datasets, which share unknown identical features and possibly many unrelated features. Inter-feature relationships are the main source of identification which we expect. We compare the performance of contrastive learning methods for feature representations, novel partial auto-encoders, mutual-information graph optimizers, and simple statistical baselines on simulated data, public datasets, the MIMIC-III medical-record changeover, and perioperative records from before and after a medical-record system change. Performance was evaluated using both mapping of identical features and reconstruction accuracy of examples in the format of the other dataset.
Results:
Contrastive learning-based methods overall performed the best, often substantially beating the literature baseline in matching and reconstruction, especially in the more challenging real data experiments. Partial auto-encoder methods showed on-par matching with contrastive methods in all synthetic and some real datasets, along with good reconstruction. However, the statistical method we created performed reasonably well in many cases, with much less dependence on hyperparameter tuning. When validating feature match output in the EHR dataset we found that some mistakes were actually a surrogate or related feature as reviewed by two subject matter experts.
Conclusion:
In simulation studies and real-world examples, we find that inter-feature relationships are effective at identifying matching or closely related features across tabular datasets when meta-data is not available. Decoder architectures are also reasonably effective at imputing features without an exact match.}

    abstract = {Visual illusions provide valuable insights into the brain’s interpretation of the world given sensory inputs. However, the precise manner in which brain activity translates into illusory experiences remains largely unknown. Here, we leverage a brain decoding technique combined with deep neural network (DNN) representations to reconstruct illusory percepts as images from brain activity. The reconstruction model was trained on natural images to establish a link between brain activity and perceptual features and then tested on two types of illusions: illusory lines and neon color spreading. Reconstructions revealed lines and colors consistent with illusory experiences, which varied across the source visual cortical areas. This framework offers a way to materialize subjective experiences, shedding light on the brain’s internal representations of the world. Images generated from brain activity mirror illusory experiences, revealing neural representations behind subjective perception.}}
